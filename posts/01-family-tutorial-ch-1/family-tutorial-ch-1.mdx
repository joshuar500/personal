I've always been terrible at explaining things, but over the years, I feel like I've gotten a wee bit better. And even if that's not true, I want to attempt to teach you guys something that I've always been passionate about. I want to teach you guys how to program. Even if it's just the basics. I want to be able to convey in plain English what it is that makes it so fun and satisfying for me and why I think you can enjoy it too!

One of the best ways to learn something new is by relating it to things you already know. So I want to explain a concept called `variables`, which is a classy word in programming that is defined in some random dictionary as:

> _a symbolic name given to an unknown quantity that permits the name to be used independent of the information it represents_

But this doesn't really help us or explain ANYTHING AT ALL. So let's take a step back. Let's figure out how we can relate variables to something we already know. For example, CHORES (our favorite thing in the whole world).

Let's pretend that mom wants to assign a bunch of chores to us. She starts with my name first.

Congratulations! You've officially written your own variables (and that darn missing value)! Mom and Dad would be so proud. Notice that you can pretty much assign these chores to anybody. You can even assign them all to Dad! Just kidding. The computer actually wouldn't like that and in fact might give you an error or tell you that he's only going to do the last chore since a variable can only hold one value at a time. But the bigger thing to understand is that you can name the variable anything and it will always equal to the thing that is on the right hand side of it. What we did in our case was assign a chore to each person in our family. And a classy way to say this is _we assigned a value to a variable_.

In the next post, we'll continue with this concept of variables (things that hold values) and explore what other things they can hold.
